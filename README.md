# Joke-Bot

This bot uses an API I found online that tells jokes based on commands that it reads from the channels it's in, and if you say a sad word. The bot uses Replits database to store the custom jokes added by users.

A list of commands are as follows:
$commands: lists all the commands
$joke: prints any joke from the joke API or custom ones
$prog: prints programming jokes from the joke API
$misc: prints miscellaneous jokes from the joke API
$dark: prints dark jokes from the joke API
$pun: prints punny jokes from the joke API
$spok: prints halloween themed jokes from the joke API
$xmas: prints christmas themed jokes from the joke API
$cust: prints custom jokes that can be added by users
$new: used to add custom jokes, by adding the joke after the command
$del: deletes custom jokes, by adding the index of the joke after the command
